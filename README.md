2. Deploy VFL Manager code
3. Update environment variables
4. Register new Discord commands
5. Configure VFL-specific channels

## Contributing

### Development Setup

VFL Manager welcomes contributions! To run a local development version:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your .env file

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Start Firestore emulator (optional)
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

### Original Snallabot Components

The original Snallabot functionality is preserved and enhanced:
- Node 21 (greater should be okay)
- Discord Application - free to register on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

```sh
npm install
PUBLIC_KEY=??? DISCORD_TOKEN=??? APP_ID=??? DEPLOYMENT_URL=localhost:3000 npm run dev
```

Fill in the env variables with the ones from your Discord application. This will setup a firebase emulator, use local file storage, and make a local version of VFL Manager available at `localhost:3000`

### Additional Components

VFL Manager includes the original Snallabot components plus new automation:

#### EA Token Refresher

There are two EA tokens: access_token and refresh_token. The access_token expires after 4 hours, and then to retrieve a new one you use the refresh_token. This will give you a new access_token and refresh_token. Seemingly, both tokens will eventually expire after around 10 days of usage. Snallabot keeps all dashboards refreshed, and exports data with [ea_refresher.ts](https://github.com/snallabot/snallabot-service/blob/main/src/dashboard/ea_refresher.ts) file. This is an example of a way to keep data fresh. I recommend using it as reference and writing your own.

#### Youtube Notifier

This checks all youtube channels that have been added to Snallabot and sends messages in Discord if that channel is playing a game in that server's league (based on stream titles). Snallabot currently runs this every 10 minutes as a chron job.

```
npm run build && npm run yt-notifier
```

#### Twitch Notifier

VFL Manager includes Twitch integration for stream notifications.

#### VFL Automation Systems

New automation systems for VFL Manager:

**Trades Monitor**
```bash
# Automatically posts new trades to Discord channels
# Runs continuously via real-time Firestore listeners
```

**Scores Monitor**  
```bash
# Automatically posts game results to Discord channels
# Supports live game updates and final scores
```

## üìä Analytics and Monitoring

VFL Manager includes comprehensive analytics:
- Command usage statistics
- User engagement metrics
- League activity trends
- System performance monitoring
- Real-time dashboard updates

## üîí Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Firestore security rules
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection
- **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS encryption everywhere

## üéØ Roadmap

Future enhancements planned:
- [ ] Mobile app for league management
- [ ] Advanced statistical analysis
- [ ] Integration with fantasy platforms
- [ ] Machine learning for trade analysis
- [ ] Real-time game tracking
